          I am currently working as a Web Developer at Stage Front Tickets, a
          ticket brokerage company. My team is working on a new platform with a
          cutting edge stack (React,Redux,and .NET core). I have already had the
          opportunity to take charge of large projects and suggest and implement
          many new technologies at my time at Stage Front.

          Previously I was working as a Software Developer at Sitetracker, a
          project management company that manages projects for many different
          clients, such as Verizon and Vodafone. I wasthe development lead in
          over 10 of the companies we work with, and have learned how to
          prioritize their different needs, meet deadlines, and communicate with
          the people on the team to make sure that goals are reached
          effectively.

          My name is George Beckert, I am currently working as a software
          developer for A Project management company named Sitetracker. My main
          focus is in full stack web development. I am the most comfortable
          using the MERN stack (Mongo,Express,React,Node.js), but I am always
          pursuing new technologies to become a more well rounded developer.
          When I am not programming I love to play guitar and paint. I strive to
          surround myself with art and music, and to absorb as much as I can
          from the people and the world around me. I think of programming as a
          blank canvas, and the more I learn from other people and other
          disciplines, the more ideas I am able to implement.
