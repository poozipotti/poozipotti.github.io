          I am currently working as a Web Developer at Stage Front Tickets, a
          ticket brokerage company. My team is working on a new platform with a
          cutting edge stack (React,Redux,and .NET core). I have already had the
          opportunity to take charge of large projects and suggest and implement
          many new technologies at my time at Stage Front.

          Previously I was working as a Software Developer at Sitetracker, a
          project management company that manages projects for many different
          clients, such as Verizon and Vodafone. I wasthe development lead in
          over 10 of the companies we work with, and have learned how to
          prioritize their different needs, meet deadlines, and communicate with
          the people on the team to make sure that goals are reached
          effectively.
