	<h2>Focus</h2>
	<p class="aboutMe">	
		My aim is to become a full stack web developer, with a focus on the back-end. I am currently in the process of learning the MEAN stack, through various projects of my own. There are so many tools
		for web developement out there, that I am documenting my learning process in the Blog portion of the site. Hopefully this can help others, who find the world of web devlopement a little daunting at first,
		and also explain my devlopement process.
